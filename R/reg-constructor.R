#' Construct a Regressor Object
#' 
#' Creates an object representing event-related regressors for fMRI modeling.
#' This function defines event onsets and associates them with a hemodynamic 
#' response function (HRF) to generate predicted time courses.
#' 
#' @param onsets A numeric vector of event onset times in seconds.
#' @param hrf The hemodynamic response function (HRF) to convolve with the events.
#'   This can be a pre-defined `HRF` object (e.g., `HRF_SPMG1`), a custom `HRF` 
#'   object created with `as_hrf`, a function `f(t)`, or a character string 
#'   referring to a known HRF type (e.g., "spmg1", "gaussian"). Defaults to `HRF_SPMG1`.
#' @param duration A numeric scalar or vector specifying the duration of each event 
#'   in seconds. If scalar, it's applied to all events. Defaults to 0 (impulse events).
#' @param amplitude A numeric scalar or vector specifying the amplitude (scaling factor) 
#'   for each event. If scalar, it's applied to all events. Defaults to 1.
#' @param span The temporal window (in seconds) over which the HRF is defined 
#'   or evaluated. This influences the length of the convolution. If not provided, 
#'   it may be inferred from the `hrf` object or default to 40s. **Note:** Unlike some
#'   previous versions, the `span` is not automatically adjusted based on `duration`;
#'   ensure the provided or inferred `span` is sufficient for your longest event duration.
#' @param summate Logical scalar; if `TRUE` (default), the HRF response amplitude scales
#'   with the duration of sustained events (via internal convolution/summation). If `FALSE`,
#'   the response reflects the peak HRF reached during the event duration.
#'   
#' @details 
#' This function serves as the main public interface for creating regressor objects. 
#' Internally, it utilizes the `Reg()` constructor which performs validation and 
#' efficient storage. The resulting object can be evaluated at specific time points 
#' using the `evaluate()` function.
#' 
#' Events with an amplitude of 0 are automatically filtered out.
#' 
#' @return An S3 object of class `Reg` and `list`
#'   containing processed event information and the HRF specification. The
#'   object includes a `filtered_all` attribute indicating whether all events
#'   were removed due to zero or `NA` amplitudes.
#' @importFrom assertthat assert_that

regressor <- Reg # Assign Reg directly to regressor


#' Create an Empty Regressor Object
#' 
#' A convenience function to create a regressor object representing no events. 
#' Useful for placeholder or baseline scenarios.
#' 
#' @param hrf The HRF object to associate (defaults to `HRF_SPMG1`).
#' @param span The span to associate (defaults to 24).
#' @return A `Reg` object representing zero events.
#' @noRd
null_regressor <- function(hrf=HRF_SPMG1, span=24) {
  # Calls Reg directly, ensuring amplitude=0 triggers empty result
  Reg(onsets = numeric(0), hrf = hrf, span = span, amplitude = 0) 
}


#' Create a single trial regressor
#'
#' Creates a regressor object for modeling a single trial event in an fMRI experiment.
#' This is particularly useful for trial-wise analyses where each trial needs to be
#' modeled separately. The regressor represents the predicted BOLD response for a single
#' event using a specified hemodynamic response function (HRF).
#'
#' This is a convenience wrapper around `regressor` that ensures inputs have length 1.
#'
#' @param onsets the event onset in seconds, must be of length 1.
#' @param hrf a hemodynamic response function, e.g. \code{HRF_SPMG1}
#' @param duration duration of the event (default is 0), must be length 1.
#' @param amplitude scaling vector (default is 1), must be length 1.
#' @param span the temporal window of the impulse response function (default is 24).
#' @return A `Reg` object (inheriting from `regressor` and `list`).
#' @seealso \code{\link{regressor}}
