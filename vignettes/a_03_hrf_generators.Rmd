## Why Generators?

Most pre-defined HRFs in `fmrireg` (like `HRF_SPMG1` or `HRF_GAUSSIAN`) are ready-to-use objects.  
However, some HRFs are actually *generators*. A generator is a function that
creates a new HRF object when you call it. This allows you to specify the number
of basis functions (`nbasis`) and the time span (`span`) at creation time.

The library provides generators for flexible basis sets such as B-splines and
finite impulse response (FIR) models. They are available through the internal
`HRF_REGISTRY` and are also returned by `list_available_hrfs()` with type
"generator".

```{r list-generators}
list_available_hrfs(details = TRUE) %>%
  dplyr::filter(type == "generator")
```

## Creating a Basis with a Generator

To obtain an actual HRF object from a generator, simply call the generator
function with your desired parameters. For example, to create a B-spline basis
with 8 functions spanning 32 seconds:

```{r create-basis}
bs8 <- hrf_bspline_generator(nbasis = 8, span = 32)
print(bs8)
```

The returned value is a standard `HRF` object, so you can evaluate it or use it
in model formulas like any other HRF.

```{r eval-basis}
times <- seq(0, 32, by = 0.5)
mat <- bs8(times)
head(mat)
```

## Visualising FIR Basis Functions

Here is a quick look at an FIR basis generated with 10 bins over a 20 second
window:

```{r fir-basis}
fir10 <- hrf_fir_generator(nbasis = 10, span = 20)
resp <- fir10(times)

fir_df <- data.frame(Time = times, resp)
fir_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(fir_df, -Time)

ggplot(fir_long, aes(Time, value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Finite Impulse Response Basis",
       x = "Time (s)", y = "Response") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Using `getHRF`

The helper `getHRF()` selects either a pre-defined object or a generator based on
name. When the chosen entry is a generator, `getHRF()` automatically calls it
with your `nbasis` and `span` arguments.

```{r gethrf}
custom_fir <- getHRF("fir", nbasis = 6, span = 18)
custom_fir
```

This is equivalent to calling `hrf_fir_generator(nbasis = 6, span = 18)`.

## Summary

Generator functions are simple factories that let you customise flexible HRF
bases. They return normal `HRF` objects, which means you can evaluate them,
combine them with decorators, or insert them into regressors just like the
built-in HRFs.
