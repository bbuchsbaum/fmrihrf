\title{Derivative method for SPMG2 HRF}
\usage{
\method{deriv}{SPMG2_HRF}(x, t, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An SPMG2_HRF object}

\item{t}{Numeric vector of time points at which to evaluate the derivative}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Matrix with 2 columns of derivative values
}
\description{
Returns derivatives for both the canonical HRF and its temporal derivative.
The first column contains the derivative of the canonical HRF, and the second
column contains the second derivative (derivative of the temporal derivative).
