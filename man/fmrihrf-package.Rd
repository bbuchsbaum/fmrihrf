\title{fmrihrf: Hemodynamic Response Function Modeling for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging}
\description{
Creates, manipulates, and evaluates hemodynamic response functions and event-related regressors for functional magnetic resonance imaging data analysis. Supports multiple basis sets including SPM canonical, gamma, Gaussian, B-spline, and Fourier bases. Features decorators for time-shifting and blocking, and efficient convolution algorithms for regressor construction.
}
\details{
The fmrihrf package provides tools for creating, manipulating, and evaluating
Hemodynamic Response Functions (HRFs) and event-related regressors
for fMRI data analysis.
