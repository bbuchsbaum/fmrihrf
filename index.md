Creates, manipulates, and evaluates hemodynamic response functions and
event-related regressors for functional magnetic resonance imaging data
analysis. Supports multiple basis sets including Canonical, Gamma,
Gaussian, B-spline, and Fourier bases. Features decorators for
time-shifting and blocking, and efficient convolution algorithms for
regressor construction. Methods are based on standard fMRI analysis
techniques as described in Jezzard et al. (2001, ISBN:9780192630711).
