# fmrihrf

Hemodynamic response functions and event-related regressors for fMRI
analysis in R.

**fmrihrf** provides a composable toolkit for constructing, modifying,
and convolving HRFs with experimental designs. It ships with standard
basis sets (SPM canonical, B-spline, Fourier, FIR, Gamma, Gaussian, and
more), decorators for time-shifting and blocking, and a fast C++
convolution backend.

## Installation

``` r
# From CRAN
install.packages("fmrihrf")

# Development version
remotes::install_github("bbuchsbaum/fmrihrf")
```

## Quick start

``` r
library(fmrihrf)

# Evaluate the SPM canonical HRF over 0-30 seconds
t <- seq(0, 30, by = 0.1)
y <- evaluate(HRF_SPMG1, t)
plot(t, y, type = "l", xlab = "Time (s)", ylab = "Response")

# Build a regressor from event onsets
reg <- regressor(onsets = c(2, 10, 18), hrf = HRF_SPMG1,
                 duration = 0, amplitude = 1,
                 span = 24, sampling_frame = sampling_frame(blocklens = 100, TR = 1))
plot(reg)
```

## Key features

**Multiple basis sets** — Use a single canonical HRF or a flexible basis
set to capture response variability.

``` r
HRF_SPMG1                                    # SPM canonical (double gamma)
HRF_SPMG3                                    # canonical + temporal & dispersion derivatives
hrf_bspline(t, N = 6)                        # B-spline basis
hrf_fourier(t, N = 5)                        # Fourier basis
```

**Decorators** — Modify any HRF through functional composition.

``` r
lag_hrf(HRF_SPMG1, lag = 2)                  # shift peak by 2 s
block_hrf(HRF_SPMG1, width = 15)             # sustained/blocked response
normalise_hrf(HRF_SPMG1)                     # unit peak-normalised
```

**Custom HRFs** — Wrap any `f(t)` into the HRF system.

``` r
my_hrf <- as_hrf(function(t) exp(-t / 5), name = "exponential", span = 20)
evaluate(my_hrf, seq(0, 20, by = 1))
```

**Regressor construction** — Convolve events with HRFs to produce
design-matrix columns, with support for variable durations, amplitudes,
and multi-basis expansion.

``` r
sf <- sampling_frame(blocklens = c(200, 200), TR = 2)
reg <- regressor(onsets = c(10, 30, 50), hrf = HRF_SPMG1,
                 duration = c(0, 5, 0), amplitude = c(1, 1.5, 1),
                 sampling_frame = sf)
evaluate(reg)
```

**Fast convolution** — Core routines are implemented in C++ (Rcpp /
RcppArmadillo) for efficient large-scale design matrix generation.
