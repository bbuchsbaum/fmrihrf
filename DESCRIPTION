Title: Hemodynamic Response Functions for fMRI Data Analysis
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Bradley", "Buchsbaum", email = "brad.buchsbaum@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Creates, manipulates, and evaluates hemodynamic response functions
    and event-related regressors for functional magnetic resonance imaging data
    analysis. Supports multiple basis sets including Canonical, Gamma, Gaussian,
    B-spline, and Fourier bases. Features decorators for time-shifting and blocking,
    and efficient convolution algorithms for regressor construction. Methods are based
    on standard fMRI analysis techniques as described in Jezzard et al. (2001, ISBN:9780192630711).
